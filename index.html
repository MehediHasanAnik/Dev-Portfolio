            You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains.
            But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning
            and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the
            Web Development Hero.

            I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple
            website. I can even teach my grandma how to make simple website. My
            goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.

            I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything
            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
            web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
            JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you
            100% web solution.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
